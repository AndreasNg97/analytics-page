# Nextgen Innovation Analytics Page
This is my implementation of the challenge diggit/sci-code provided.

## Installation and Setup
You will need node and npm installed globally on your machine.

Installation:
```bash
npm install
```
To Start Server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Libraries and Frameworks
*  React v16.13.1
*  Bootstrap v4.5.2
*  chart.js v2.9.3
*  react-chartjs-2 v2.10.0
*  moment v2.27.0


## Reflection
During the challenge I learned alot of how I should structure a whole website. I started of slow, but when I had the hang of it it went pretty smoothly. 
I used a lot of time to make the site responsive, and to make the code as effective as possible.

There was a lot of times I had to rewrite codes because of how uneffective or just how bad the code was written.

### Things I wanted to implement

* More interaction with the Vertical and Horizontal navigation bar.(More interaction on the page overall)
* The fancy hover effect over the line chart.
* Cooler responsive layout
